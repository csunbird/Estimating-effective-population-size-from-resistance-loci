## Burn in simulations
Code and simulated burn in populations on SLIM from previous students

## Running SLIM simulations via HPC 
- TO DO: Make matrix txt file
- TO DO: Write python script that iterates over all 27 scenarios etc


## Python code
- calculate homozygosity to find haplotypes
- TO DO: 
Calculate haplotype lengths, max, minimum nt.


## Haplotype graph tests
Work done by TSH11, Anusha and previous students
TO DO: Add my own calculated graph etc
